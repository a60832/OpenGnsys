# OpenGnsys

The OpenGnsys Project (pronounced *Open Genesis*) brings together the combined efforts of several Spanish Public Universities to provide a number of free and open source tools for managing and deploying computers. These tools supply a complete, versatile and intuitive system that allows the arrangement, installation and deployment of different operating systems.

OpenGnsys is based on a modular architecture separated into different service layers which allows its implementation in several educational and organizational IT environments, both in a centralized or distributed way. The main management of the system is carried out by means of a simple web interface which supports delegated administration. OpenGnsys is also suitable for isolated environments, being able to work in network failure conditions (offline mode).
