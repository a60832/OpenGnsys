Installing OpenGnsys Server v 1.1.1
===================================

Before installation
-------------------

OpenGnsys Server 1.1.1 is meant to be installed under Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS or newer, though it has also been tested under operating systems based on CentOS 7.

Network connection is needed in order to download the required packages, the source code and the preconfigured client.

Minimum storage requirements:
- 100 MB in /tmp (for the installation process)
- 450 MB in /var/lib/tftpboot (or /srv in Debian systems)
- 500 MB in the installation folder (/opt/opengnsys) in addition to the space required for logging (100 MB if ogLive client is already downloaded).
- Enough disk space for the image repository in /opt/opengnsys/images (it is recommended to mount it on an independent file system)
